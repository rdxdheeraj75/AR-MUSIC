# Music with AR:
 
It is web application where we can play and control music components using Augmented Reality features.  We set some predefined objects and control them in our real-time environment.

Motivation of this project was to learn and implement new technologies.

I have used A-Frame, Ar.js and Howler libraries to develop it.

## A-Frame: 
It is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. A-Frame is based on top of HTML, making it simple to get started. A-Frame was developed to be an easy yet powerful way to develop VR content. As an independent open-source project, A-Frame has grown to be one of the largest VR communities.
### Features

VR Made Simple: Just drop in a <script> tag and <a-scene>. A-Frame will handle 3D boilerplate, VR setup, and default controls. Nothing to install.

HTML is easy to read, understand, and copy-and-paste. Being based on top of HTML, A-Frame is available to everyone: web developers, VR enthusiasts, artists, designers, educators, makers, kids.

A-Frame has been used by companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oculus, and Samsung. They have made contributions to A-Frame.

#### Alternatives â€“ Forge and Daydream.

## AR.js:
AR.js is an efficient Augmented Reality solution on the Web. It runs 100% in our web browser; this means no app to install! There is no need for a specific device either. It runs on all mobile platforms: Android and iOS. We can use it with our own phone. the camera is being moved by AR.js 

#### Alternatives  - ARToolKit (problem with this was that it needs the physical location of user to work properly)

## Howler.js:
It is Audio library for the modern web.howler.js makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.

### Features: 

A single API for all of our audio needs makes our audio experiences fun and easy.

Works Everywhere

Full Control - Control everything from play, pause and fade and loop.

#### Alternatives - SoundManager
